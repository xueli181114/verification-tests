  Scenario: Deploy cluster-logging operator via web console.
    # clear the logging related resources
    Given logging service is removed successfully
    Given the logging operators are redeployed after scenario
    Given logging channel name is stored in the :logging_channel clipboard
    Given I obtain test data file "logging/clusterlogging/deploy_clo_via_olm/01_clo_ns.yaml"
    Given I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | 01_clo_ns.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I register clean-up steps:
    """
    Given logging service is removed successfully
    Then the step should succeed

    Given "cluster-logging" packagemanifest's operator source name is stored in the :clo_opsrc clipboard
    Given I switch to the first user
    Given the first user is cluster-admin
    Given I open admin console in a browser
    # subscribe cluster-logging-operator
    When I perform the :goto_operator_subscription_page web action with:

  Scenario: Deploy elasticsearch-operator via Web Console
    # clear the logging related resources

    Given I open admin console in a browser

    Given I use the "openshift-operators" project
    Given I wait for the "elasticsearch-operator" subscriptions to appear
    And evaluation of `subscription("elasticsearch-operator").current_csv` is stored in the :eo_csv clipboard
    Given admin ensures "<%= cb.eo_csv %>" cluster_service_version is deleted from the "openshift-operators" project after scenario
    Given elasticsearch operator is ready in the "openshift-operators" namespace
