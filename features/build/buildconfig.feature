  Scenario Outline: Build with images pulled from private repositories
    Given I have a project
    When I run the :create_secret client command with:
     | name        | pull                                                                            |
     | secret_type | generic                                                                         |
     | from_file   | .dockercfg=<%= expand_private_path(conf[:services, :docker_hub, :dockercfg]) %> | 
     | type        | kubernetes.io/dockercfg                                                         |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I obtain test data file "build/<template>"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | <template> |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby-sample-build-1" build was created
    Then the "ruby-sample-build-1" build completes

    Examples:
      | template                              |

    Then the step should succeed
    Given I obtain test data file "templates/OCP-12057/application-template-stibuild_pull_private_sourceimage.json"
    When I run the :new_app client command with:
     | file | application-template-stibuild_pull_private_sourceimage.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the "ruby-sample-build-1" build was created
    And the "ruby-sample-build-1" build completed
    Given a pod becomes ready with labels:
