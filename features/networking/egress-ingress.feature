  Scenario: EgressNetworkPolicy will not take effect after delete it
    Given the env is using multitenant or networkpolicy network
    Given I have a project
    Given I have a pod-for-ping in the project
    When I execute on the pod:
      | curl           |
      | --head         |
      | www.google.com | 
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "HTTP/1.1 200" 
    When I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | <%= BushSlicer::HOME %>/testdata/networking/egressnetworkpolicy/limit_policy.json |
      | n | <%= project.name %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I select a random node's host 
    When I use the "<%= project.name %>" project
    When I execute on the pod:
      | curl | --connect-timeout | 5 | --head | www.google.com |
    Then the step should fail
    When I run the :delete admin command with:
      | object_type       | egressnetworkpolicy |
      | object_name_or_id | policy1             |
      | n                 | <%= project.name %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I select a random node's host 
    When I use the "<%= project.name %>" project
    When I execute on the pod:
      | curl           |
      | --head         |
      | www.google.com |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain "HTTP/1.1 200"

  Scenario: Apply different egress network policy in different projects
