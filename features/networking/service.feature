  Scenario: tenants can access their own services
    # create pod and service in project1
    Given the env is using multitenant network
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "networking/list_for_pods.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | list_for_pods.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=test-pods |
    Given I use the "test-service" service
    And evaluation of `service.ip(user: user)` is stored in the :service1_ip clipboard
    Given I wait for the "test-service" service to become ready

    # create pod and service in project2
    Given I switch to the second user
    And I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "networking/list_for_pods.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | list_for_pods.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    And a pod becomes ready with labels:
      | name=test-pods |
    Given I use the "test-service" service
    And evaluation of `service.ip(user: user)` is stored in the :service2_ip clipboard

    # access service in project2
    Given I have a pod-for-ping in the project
    When I execute on the pod:
      | /usr/bin/curl | -k | <%= cb.service2_ip %>:27017 |
    Then the output should contain:
      | Hello OpenShift |

    # access service in project1
    When I execute on the pod:
      | /usr/bin/curl | --connect-timeout | 4 | <%= cb.service1_ip %>:27017 |
    Then the step should fail
    Then the output should not contain:
      | Hello OpenShift |

  Scenario: The openflow list will be cleaned after delete the services
    Given the env is using one of the listed network plugins:
      | subnet      |
      | multitenant |
    Given I have a project
    Given I obtain test data file "routing/unsecure/service_unsecure.json"
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | service_unsecure.json |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I use the "service-unsecure" service
    And evaluation of `service.ip(user: user)` is stored in the :service_ip clipboard
    Given I select a random node's host
    When I run ovs dump flows commands on the host
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain:
      | <%= cb.service_ip %> |
    When I run the :delete client command with:
      | object_type       | svc              |
      | object_name_or_id | service-unsecure |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given I select a random node's host
    When I run ovs dump flows commands on the host
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should not contain:
      | <%= cb.service_ip %> |

    Given I store the masters in the :masters clipboard
    And the Internal IP of node "<%= cb.masters[0].name %>" is stored in the :master_ip clipboard
    Given I select a random node's host
