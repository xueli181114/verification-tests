  Scenario: Upgrade - Make sure multiple resources work well after upgrade - prepare
    Given I switch to the first user
    # Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    When I run the :new_project client command with:
      | project_name | node-upgrade |
    And I use the "node-upgrade" project
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | <%= BushSlicer::HOME %>/features/tierN/testdata/infrastructure/hpa/hpa-v2beta1-rc.yaml |
    Then the step should succeed
    Given 1 pods become ready with labels:
      | run=hello-openshift |
    When I run the :create client command with:
      | f | <%= BushSlicer::HOME %>/features/tierN/testdata/infrastructure/hpa/resource-metrics-cpu.yaml |

    Given I wait up to 300 seconds for the steps to pass:

  Scenario: Upgrade - Make sure multiple resources work well after upgrade
